        <p className="font-bold my-4">Subscription</p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          If you purchase a subscription to receive Content (“
          <strong>Subscription</strong>”) such Subscription will be billed
          automatically in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“
          <strong>Billing Cycle</strong>”). Billing cycles are set either on a
          monthly, quarterly, annual, or biennial basis, depending on the type
          of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required
          to process the payment for your Subscription. By submitting such
          payment information, you automatically authorize Educative to charge
          all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such
          payment instruments.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will be
          automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees on a monthly,
          quarterly, annual, or biennial basis and the subscription will
          continue until you cancel, or we cancel it. You must cancel 24 hours
          before the monthly, quarterly, annual, or biennial subscription
          renewals to avoid future charges. You may cancel your Subscription
          renewal either through your online account management page or by
          contacting Educative’s customer support team.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold my-4">Fees</p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          The fees for Subscriptions are as set forth in the Service. Educative
          may modify the fees at any time. If you have purchased a Subscription,
          any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the
          then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Educative will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
          change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
          your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued
          use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
          constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee
          amount.

        <p className="font-bold my-4">Payments</p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          In order to purchase a Subscription, you must provide Educative’s
          third party payment processor with certain information including,
          without limitation, your name, your credit card number, the expiration
          date of your credit card, and your billing address. Our payment
          processor is only permitted to use such data to process your purchase.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          By making a purchase with a credit card or other authorized method of
          payment, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right
          to use such credit card(s) or other payment method(s); and (ii) the
          information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for
          reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability,
          errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in
          your order or other reasons. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel
          your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is
          suspected.

        <p className="text-sm">
          In the event of payment failure using the primary payment method,
          Educative reserves the right to charge the provided secondary payment
          method. Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason,
          Educative will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must
          proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
          payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the
          invoice.

        <p className="font-bold my-4">Free Trial</p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Educative may offer a free trial Subscription for a limited period of
          time (“<strong>Free Trial</strong>”).

        <p className="text-sm">
          You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign
          up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when
          signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Educative
          until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial
          period, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription
          fees on a monthly, annual or biennial basis and the subscription will
          continue until you cancel. You must cancel 24 hours before the
          monthly, annual, or biennial subscription renews to avoid future
          charges.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          At any time and without notice, Educative, Inc reserves the right to
          (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii)
          cancel such Free Trial offer.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold my-4">Refunds</p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          If you purchase an unlimited access Subscription and cancel within a
          reasonable time after your initial purchase, you may apply for a
          refund (which we may grant or deny in our sole discretion). We reserve
          the right to reject refund requests for any reason, including if we
          suspect abuse of the refund system or intentionally fraudulent
          behavior.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm">
          Upon cancellation of a Subscription, all rights you have in any
          Content you acquired prior to cancellation are immediately revoked and
          you must delete all copies of any Content you have downloaded or
          cached.
